I studied informatics at FSU Jena in Germany. During my studies, I specialized in computer vision and software engineering.
I just finished my PhD at the University of Bern and I am involved in the [VariantSync](https://github.com/VariantSync) project.

I am a software engineer and researcher specializing in software variability and evolution, who thrives on solving complex software engineering problems.
My previous work focused on developing practical, innovative techniques to support the maintenance of co-evolving software variants and multi-release branches.
