I am a software engineer and researcher specializing in software variability and evolution, who thrives on solving complex software engineering problems.
My previous work focused on developing practical, innovative techniques to support the maintenance of co-evolving software variants and multi-release branches.

I studied Computer Science at FSU Jena in Germany. During my studies, I specialized in computer vision and software engineering.
Afterwards, I completed a PhD at the University of Bern, where I was involved in the [VariantSync](https://github.com/VariantSync) project.
