I studied informatics at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena. During my studies, I focused on computer vision and software engineering.

Since March 2019, I am a Doctoral student at Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin and part of the VariantSync project. I am also associated with the Software Engineering Group at the University of Bern. 

My main research interests lie in the systematic support of multi-variant software development, version control, and improving the way in which we as a community conduct our scientific work.
