I studied informatics at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena. During my studies, I focused on computer vision and software engineering.

Currently, I am a PhD candidate at University of Bern University and Paderborn University. I am also part of the VariantSync project. 

My main research interests lie in the systematic support of multi-variant software development, version control, and improving the way in which we as a community conduct our scientific work.
