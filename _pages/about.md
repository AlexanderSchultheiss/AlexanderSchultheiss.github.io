I studied informatics at FSU Jena in Germany. During my studies, I specialized in computer vision and software engineering.

I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Bern and a Research Associate at Paderborn University. Additionally, I am involved in the [VariantSync](https://github.com/VariantSync) project.

My primary research interests focus on systematically supporting multi-variant software development through patch automation, version control, and enhancing the methods by which our scientific community conducts research.
