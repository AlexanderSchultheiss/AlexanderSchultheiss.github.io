I studied informatics at the FSU Jena, Germany. During my studies, I focused on computer vision and software engineering.

Currently, I am a PhD candidate at Bern University and Paderborn University. I am also part of the [VariantSync](https://github.com/VariantSync) project. 

My main research interests lie in the systematic support of multi-variant software development through patch automation, version control, and improving the way in which we as a community conduct our scientific work.
